IBKit is open source Interactive Brokers API library written in Swift. It allows you to automate trades, retrieve market data and monitor positions and orders. Offering both live and paper trading capabilities, it can be used as an algo trading platform or as an backtesting datasource. In latter case you need to write your own portfolio accounting and performance measurement methods.

The software is not an official API and is not affiliated or related with Interactive Brokers.
